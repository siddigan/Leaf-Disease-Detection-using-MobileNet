# Leaf-Disease-Detection-using-MobileNet

The Leaf Disease Detection using MobileNet Project is a computer vision project that aims to detect and classify plant diseases based on images of plant leaves. The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on the MobileNet architecture, which has been pre-trained on a large dataset of images. The CNN model is fine-tuned using a smaller dataset of images specific to the plant diseases of interest.

The project includes several steps, including data collection and preparation, model training and evaluation, and deployment of the model to a mobile app. The dataset used for training and testing the model includes images of healthy and diseased leaves of various plants, including tomatoes and potatoes.

The model is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The final model is deployed to a mobile app that allows users to take pictures of plant leaves and get a diagnosis of any diseases present. The app also provides information about the specific disease and recommendations for treatment.

Overall, the Leaf Disease Detection using MobileNet Project aims to provide a practical solution for farmers and gardeners to quickly and accurately diagnose plant diseases, allowing them to take appropriate action to prevent crop losses and maintain healthy plants.
